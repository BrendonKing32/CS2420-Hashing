Implement an Insertion Sort, Shellsort, and a Quicksort.  Run each sort with the three files provided on canvas and determine the 
running time and number of compares for each file with each sort.  Use the clock function and clock_t data type to obtain the 
number of clock ticks each sort takes with each file.  Write each sorted file as a new file, there will be 9 of them.  Output to the 
screen the name of the sort, file number, elapsed clock ticks for the sort, elapsed time in seconds, and the output file name of the 
sorted file.  Write your program according to the documentation standards established for the class.  You cannot use the sort 
algorithms in the standard template library.  You must write the code for each of the sorts yourself.
